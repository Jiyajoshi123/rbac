## 📌 Project Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used security mechanism where permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users.  
This project demonstrates how RBAC can be implemented in a real-world application to ensure **security, accountability, and controlled access**.

The system supports **multiple roles**, secure authentication, role-based authorization, and **audit logging** of all user activities.
